            With regards to author pages and experties, authority and
            trustworthiness, that's something where i'd recommend cheching that
            out with your users... how can you best show that the people who are
            creating content for your website, they're really great people,
            they're people who know what they're talking about, they have
            credentials or whatever is relevant with your field.</font
